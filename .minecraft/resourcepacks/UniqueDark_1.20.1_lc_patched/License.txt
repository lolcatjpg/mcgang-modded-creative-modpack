You cannot distribute any of my assets in any way. This includes redistribution on the Bedrock Marketplace or locking behind a paywall (e.g. Patreon).
However, if you want to use my assets in your public modpack, you can use free version of resource pack, that is public on CurseForge or Modrinth. But you have to give a clear credit to me
that should include links that were mentioned above.

When you can use assets made by me:
	If you're doing anything privately and undistributed to my assets (e.g. custom edit for personal use, unpublished add-ons, mod support, using the pack for a small private Minecraft server, or edits either by you or from different packs) you can safely disregard all of these requirements since you are not gaining unfairly from me in any form.
